            <p>This literature review was written to fulfill the thesis requirement needed for full competition of my Tufts Master of Science in Biomedical Sciences.</p>
            <p>With the first FDA-approved gene therapy drugs having just been approved in the last couple years, research and development in gene therapy for the treatment of many genetic diseases is well underway. Designing safe viral vectors has been the largest obstacle in this research, but recent studies utilizing promoters that restrict gene expression to specific tissue- or cell-types show that this modification can increase both safety and efficacy. In this review, I focus on gene therapy that utilizes lentiviruses as viral vectors to deliver transgenes to cells and how using physiological promoters in these vectors is an improvement over traditional viral promoters.</p>

            <h2 id="growth-rate-analysis">Growth Rate Analysis</h2>
            <p>Turbidostat devices give experimenters control over stresses that microorganisms often adapt to, allowing researchers to better test their own mutated strains and how they adapt to specific applied stresses. The Siegal Lab at NYU uses an open source turbidostat design from the Klavins Lab to study the evolution of yeast. Growth rate can be indicative of fitness and adaptation but previously we would have to measure growth rate through an independent experiment. I have since created automated Python software programs that analyze the optical density (OD) and dilution (U) data produced by the turidostat to dynamically estimate the growth rate of yeast in the continuous culture, giving experimenters a real-time estimate of how their microorganisms are adapting to their environment.</p>
            <p class="center"><img class="center" src="assets/research/experimental_setup.png" title="Experimental Setup">Experimental Setup</p>
            <p>The Turbidostat is an inexpensive, 3D printable, open source device developed by the Klavins Lab at the University of Washington. Their website and project can be found at <a href="http://klavinslab.org/hardware" title="Klavins Lab" target="_blank">klavinslab.org/hardware</a>. When a specific optical density has been reached, turbidostats dilute their growth chamber, removing some solution and adding some food and water. This decreases common stresses that microorganisms often adapt to such as high cell density, waste saturation, and limiting resources.</p>
            <p>Previously, the turbidostat software did not compute growth so there was no way to estimate fitness. During an experiment it would also keep density near to the limit with repeated dilutions (U), which can be used to calculate growth rate but are inaccurate. We developed an automated pipeline to continuously calculate growth rate and new modes to run experiments that allow for more growth rates based on optical density (OD), which are more accurate.</p>
            <p class="center"><img class="center" src="assets/research/pipeline.png" title="Computatinal Pipeline">Computational Pipeline</p>
            <p>Our computational pipeline can dynamically calculate growth rates, calculate summary statistics, and generate graphs for either optical density or dilution data. It is highly configurable and easily automated.</p>
            <p class="center"><img class="center" src="assets/research/block_dilutions.png" title="Block Dilutions">Block Dilutions</p>
            <p>Another program runs separate from the main experiment programs but modifies their goal optical density dynamically depending on the current OD measurements. This adds the ability to have short segments of large dilutions followed by large periods of exponential growth without dilution, which allows for more accurate and precise growth rate measurements to be taken from that period of exponential growth.</p>
            <p>I've also created a program that allows you to quickly simulate an experiment with defined noise, starting OD, and growth rate, producing hours worth of data within seconds. This program can be used to plan real experiments and test modifications to the computational pipeline.</p>

            <p>A final planned addition to the project was to automate tests for significant changes in growth rate.

            <p>This literature review was the main project required for completion of the Microbiology and Microbial Genomics course, an NYU Biology upper level elective.</p>
            <p>Spores exist in a metabolically inactive state that limits their ability to fend off DNA damage that accumulates before germination. It is only in the transition stages between spore and bacteria do DNA repair mechanisms re-active. The regulatory protein DisA has previously been shown to delay sporulation when DNA damage is found, but more recently has been shown to also delay outgrowth of a spore in a similar way. This paper explores recent findings in how DisA works in concert with DNA repair mechanisms, how it communicates regulatory messages, and its connections with other regulatory proteins during the germination stages.</p>

            <h2 id="image-analysis-pipeline">Image Analysis Pipeline</h2>
            <p>The image analysis pipeline starts with an automated microscope taking and saving images of growing yeast, producing in total a few tens of thousands of images per experiment. These images are transfered from the local lab computer to NYU's High Performance Computing network, where we run software on each image that produces around two hundred data points per image. Occasionally the images encounter errors during the analysis process because they took too long, took too much memory, or some other reason. These images have to be re-run with more time and memory dedicated to them.</p>
            <p>My work on this project involved improving the code that handles all this communications of images between the local and HPC network. Specifically, I changed Bash scripts to well documented, compartmentalized, and improved Python scripts.</p>

            <h3>Cortical networks for speech motor control in unilateral vocal fold paralysis.</h3>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To evaluate brain networks for motor control of voice production in patients with treated unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP). <br><strong>Results:</strong> Whole‐brain task‐induced beta band activation patterns were qualitatively similar in both treated UVFP patients and healthy controls. Central vocal motor control plasticity in UVFP was expressed within constitutive components of central human communication networks identified in healthy controls. Treated UVFP patients exhibited statistically significant enhancement (P &lt; 0.05) in beta band activity following pitch perturbation onset in left auditory cortex to 525 ms, left premotor cortex to 225 ms, and left and right frontal cortex to 525 ms. </p>

            <h3>Vocal motor control and central auditory impairments in unilateral vocal fold paralysis.</h3>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To evaluate differences in vocal motor control and central auditory processing between treated unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP) and healthy control cohorts. <br><strong>Results:</strong> Vocal motor control was impaired in treated UVFP. The UVFP cohort exhibited a 32.5% reduction in the instantaneous, subconscious compensatory response to pitch feedback perturbation in the interval between 150 ms and 550 ms following onset (P &lt; 0.0001, linear mixed effects model). This impairment cannot simply be ascribed to vocal motor capacity insufficiency in the UVFP cohort because both cohorts demonstrated comparable functional capacity to perform the vocal motor task. The UVFP cohort also showed greater propensity for central auditory processing impairment (P &lt; 0.05), notably for temporal compression and added noise challenges.</p>

            <h2 id="microbial-fuel-cells">Microbial Fuel Cells</h2>
            <p>Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) utilize the natural metabolism of bacteria for generating electricity. At the end of a normal electron transport chain, the metabolism of organic material drives electrons across the inner mitochondrial membrane, pumping hydrogen into the inter-membrane space for later ATP production, and uses hydrogen and oxygen as final electron acceptors to produce water. In microbial fuel cells, there is an anode that bacteria form a biofilm on and utilize as the final electron acceptor, similar to the final complex in the electron transport chain. The electron runs to a cathode, creating an electrical current that we can utilize, and combines with oxygen at the cathode to produce water. This technology can be used in water treatment plants, where bacteria metabolize waste water and this technology can capture electricity from the process.</p>
            <p class="center"><img class="center" src="assets/research/microbial_fuel_cells.png" title="Microbial Fuel Cells">Graphical representation of a microbial fuel cell.</p>
            <p>My internship in a Tel Aviv University biology lab involved research in making microbial fuel cells more efficient. Currently, MFCs are only able to generate small amounts of energy. I studied the effects of graphite and felt anodes for use in MFCs, as well as which species of bacteria are present within the MFC solution and on the anode. Measures including voltage, pH, conductivity of solution, and ammonium concentration. The main conclusion of the experiment was that the felt brush anode produced higher voltage than the graphite. To recieve academic credit towards my Biology BA, I was required to do a few presentations as well as write a short report of my research. That report can be found below.</p>
