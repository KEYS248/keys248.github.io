            <h2 id="searching-for-landscapes">Searching for Landscapes</h2>
            <p>Around 2012 I began to capture landscape views from various hikes and travels. Most of these photos come from hikes in California or my time in New York. Other photos are from travels around the U.S. and  the world. More photos can be found on my tumblr blog at <a href="http://www.best-views.tumblr.com" title="Best Views Tumblr" target="_blank">best-views.tumblr.com</a>.</p>

            <p>In order to create meaningful birthday gifts for my friends, I decided to make something for them. I chose to draw and watercolor 4 inch by 6 inch framed pieces based on previous photos I had taken that had a connection to the specific friend I was making it for. In this way the piece could be tailored to the specific friend, maintain a minimalist presence, and be built off my previous work. In this project I show the image the piece is based off, the drawing, and the final watercolor. More pieces from this project can be found on my tumblr blog at <a href="http://drawn-views.tumblr.com/" title="Drawn Views Tumblr" target="_blank">drawn-views.tumblr.com</a>.</p>

            <h2 id="animated-gifs">Animated Gifs</h2>
            <p>During photo shoots I thought it would be interesting to start capturing some timelapses. I decided to present these collected images in the form of animated gifs for easy sharing over the web. I haven't made enough of these to elicit creating a blog for them, but I have my favorite ones shown below.</p>

            <p>I've made a few logos for various uses. The first I use as the favicon for my experimental web page, <a href="https://www.datumplane.net" title="Datumplane" target="_blank">datumplane.net</a>. The second uses the logo I made for this web page about myself and for use as a sticker in stickers to link to my experimental web page. The third logo I redesigned from another artist to use as the logo for the <a href="https://bugs-nyu.github.io/" title="NYU BUGS" target="_blank">NYU BUGS Open Source club</a> during my undergraduate.</p>
            <p class="center"><img class="center" src="assets/creative/matrix_01.png">This logo is made to resemble a classic Gibsonian matrix, commonly found in cyberpunk culture.</p>
            <p class="center"><img class="center" src="assets/creative/datumplane_01.png">Datumplane is a reference to the Gibsonian matrix found in the Sci-Fi novel Hyperion by San Simmons. The icosahedral shape is a reference to the classic capsid of a virus, one of the most fascinating microbes in biology.</p>
            <p class="center"><img class="center" src="assets/creative/bugs_logo_1.png">Because the club focuses heavily on open source software, BUGS is in reference to computer bugs that can be more easily found and solved through making software open source. Although it is capitalized, it is not an acronym. The bug design is in classic ASCII art style, a nod to the early computer era.</p>
            <p>Sometimes I will get creative with photos from my landscape collection and make a fictional album cover. Here I drew inspiration from Mogwai's album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcore_Will_Never_Die,_but_You_Will" target="_blank" title="Mogwai Album">Hardcore Will Never Die, but You Will</a> to create my own.</p>
            <p class="center"><img class="center" src="assets/creative/hard%20lines%20softened.jpg" alt="Hard Lines Softened 1">Version 1.</p>
            <p class="center"><img class="center" src="assets/creative/hard%20lines%20softened%202.jpg" alt="Hard Lines Softened 1">Version 2.</p>
            <p class="center"><img class="center" src="assets/creative/mogwai_hardcore_will_never_die.jpg" alt="Hard Lines Softened 1">Mogwai's original artwork, from which I drew inspiration.</p>
